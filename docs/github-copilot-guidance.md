# GitHub Copilot Guidance â€“ Justice Digital

## Eligibility for a Licence

Licences are currently available only to permanent civil servants in the engineering profession, including:

## How to Request a Licence

Each agency within Justice Digital maintains a **GitHub Copilot Users Team**.

Agency leads are responsible for managing team membership, ensuring only eligible staff have access, and removing users who leave or transfer departments.

Civil servants in the engineering profession should ask their team lead to add them to the appropriate team:

- [Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA)](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/teams/cica-github-copilot-users)
- [Central Digital](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/teams/central-digital-copilot-users)

HMPPS, OPG, and LAA users must be added via pull requests to their respective team repositories:

- [HMPPS](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-github-teams)
- LAA (to be created)
- [OPG](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-org-infra/tree/main/access-management)
- [Office for the CTO (OCTO)](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/octo-access)

## What is included in the Licence

GitHub CoPilot users will be assigned [Copilot Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/plans#comparing-copilot-plans) seats. This plan was chosen to allow users greater access to premium models, such as those created by Anthropic. Each user has 1000 requests to a premium model per billing month. See the guidance [here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-ai-models/configure-access-to-ai-models) on how to select different models within your IDE.

## Enterprise Settings

Enterprise-wide settings for GitHub Copilot have been configured and documented in this decision record:  
[Enterprise-level Copilot settings](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/.github/blob/main/docs/decisions/0001-enterprise-level-copilot-settings.md)

These settings automatically apply to all organisations within the MoJ GitHub enterprise.  
If you wish to request changes to these settings, please contact the [project responsible ownwer](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/.github/blob/main/docs/decisions/0001-enterprise-level-copilot-settings.md#key-roles-and-responsibilities).

## Permitted AI Tools in MoJ

Only AI tools under an MoJ enterprise licence are permitted.

**Approved tools include:**
- GitHub Copilot for Enterprise
- Copilot 365
- ChatGPT Pilot Programme (by request)

Personal or free AI tools are **not allowed**.

Enterprise tools do **not** train models on user code, prompts, or data; personal tools may lack these safeguards.

---

## Monitoring and Usage

GitHub Copilot usage is auditable via the GitHub Enterprise Account.

The Developer Experience Team (within OCTO) will, once launched, monitor usage across Justice Digital.

Licences may be reallocated if unused for extended periods.

---

## Copilot Capabilities and Data Handling

Users agree to the General Terms & Conditions when using GitHub Copilot.

Copilot for Enterprise does **not** train on GitHub repositories or cloud-hosted code.

Suggestions are generated based on the open project on the user's local machine and their prompt.

Code generated by Copilot is owned by HMG; Microsoft claims no IP rights.

GitHub confirms no user data is used for model training, including prompts, code, suggestions, or user information.
